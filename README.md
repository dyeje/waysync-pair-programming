# WaySync Pair Programming Exercise

## Development server

## Carrier APIs

You can see the API specs in the `api-specs` folder. All requests to these APIs are mocked, please use [one of these HTTP libraries](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock/blob/master/README.md#supported-http-libraries) to ensure mocking works. The mocks do not catch invalid requests (yet), so I'll let you know if you've made one.

If you would like to see visual documentation, you can load the spec files into [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).
